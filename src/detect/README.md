# `detect/`

Uses Harold Mills's 
[reimplementation of the Old Bird detections software](https://github.com/HaroldMills/Vesper/tree/master/vesper/old_bird) 
to extract out crossbill vocalizations

Necessary files for the detector include:
* `crossbill_detector.py`: the main script used for creating a detector and extracting resulting .wav files
* `argument_parser.py`: for parsing command-line input to `crossbill_detector.py`
* `old_bird_detector_redux_1_1.py`: Harold Mills's reimplementation, plus some edits to allow for new settings
* `audio_file_utils.py`: Harold Mills's module
* `bunch.py`: Harold Mills's module

Additional files used to investigate the detector's output:
* `compare-files.py`: for comparing detections generated by different settings 
* `plotter.py`: for plotting graphs of detection lengths
* `quality_control.py`: for manual quality control of files
