# crossbill-detect

An attempt to create a crossbill call detector based off of the work of Harold Mills. 

Harold created a [Python reimplementation](https://github.com/HaroldMills/Vesper/tree/master/vesper/old_bird) of the original [Thrush detector](http://www.oldbird.org/Thrush.htm) by Old Bird. From this project I have used `old_bird_detector_redux_1_1.py`. I am also using two utilities from Harold's ongoing [Vesper](https://github.com/HaroldMills/Vesper) project, namely `bunch.py` and `audio_file_utils.py`.

In this ongoing project, the key addition is `crossbill_detector.py`.
